# React-complex-navigation-v5

A simple integration of Complex navigation (Stack, Drawer, BottomTab) with an Auth Flow and Redux, in react native in V5
A boiler plate to use complex navigation in react native all together i.e (Stack, Drawer, BottomTab) navigators.

As in V5, it's totally different from the previous versions of navigation

Introduction about navigation (V5)
So Recently React Native has upgraded Navigation API
It has undergone some major changes
The new API comes with dynamic components. and made the navigation part more dynamic.
If you are familiar with old navigation then you must have faced many problems when you need to change something dynamically while navigating e.g a header title
Now this issue isn't there, Thanks to the component-based API, all of the configuration is happening inside the render method. This means we can access props, state, and context and can dynamically change configuration for the navigator.
